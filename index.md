## The Lingua Franca for exchange of Knowledge

### About
The Information Exchange Standard (IES) provides a common vocabulary for the sharing of analysed intellignece between systems and organisations. This allows organisations to share data more easily, in turn making collaboration easier.

The IES provides a lingua franca (common language) proving an intermediary language between systems, which may all store and model their data differently. Instead of having to translate between all local models, systems only have to know how to translate from their own model to the IES, reducing the number of translations required for information exchange.
