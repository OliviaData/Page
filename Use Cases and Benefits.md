## Use Cases and Benefits of the Information Exchange Standard

### Exchange of Intelligence
#### Fewer Point to Point Interfaces
Across the UK Government and international partners, there are many separate knowledge stores. When this information is exchanged, point-to-point interfaces have previously been used to translate between local models. Point-to-point interfaces are highly coupled, meaning that the exchange ecosystem is very rigid and fragile to change. 

The IES provides a common language, meaning that systems only need to be able to translate between it's own model and the IES, reducing the number of translations required to exchange between a large number of systems and organisations. Through providing a common language, the IES **increases Standardisation** of data exchange, and **reduces manual effort** required to maintain point-to-point exchange.

A comparison of point-to-point interfaces and the use of the IES is shown in the diagram below.
